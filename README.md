# Citi Bike Data Analysis with Tableau

Introduction

In my role as the lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, I successfully generated comprehensive reports aimed at understanding and enhancing the city program. Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has systematically collected and organized data, accessible to the public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage. Addressing the absence of a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process, this project aimed to leverage Tableau expertise for a more insightful analysis.

## Project Execution
1. Tableau Public Account:

I saved the completed assignment to the [Tableau Public account](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alia.tirado.smith/viz/Citi-Bike_16956057239340/Story1?publish=yes), providing a centralized and accessible location for the comprehensive analysis.

2. Data Selection:

A strategic selection of 1-3 zip files from the Citi Bike Data source was undertaken. This careful curation ensured a focused and effective analysis without overwhelming Tableau with excessive data. Datasets with consistent column structures, preferably from the past year, were prioritized.
Analysis and Visualizations
Phenomena Identification and Visualization Design:

The primary task involved aggregating data from Citi Bike Trip History Logs to identify two unexpected phenomena. For each phenomenon, 2â€“5 visualizations were meticulously designed. Key questions such as total recorded trips, percentage growth in ridership, changes in user proportions, and peak hours for bike usage during different seasons were addressed. Optional dataset merging from different periods enriched the depth of analysis.
Dashboards Creation and Analysis Explanation:

Dashboards were crafted for each phenomenon, providing a visual representation of observed trends. Accompanying these visualizations was a detailed analysis, explaining the insights derived from the data.
Visualization for City Officials:
Basic Map:

A static map was designed, plotting all bike stations with visual indications of popular starting and ending locations. Zip code data was overlaid on the map to enhance the representation.
Advanced Map:

A dynamic map showcasing changes in each station's popularity over time (by month and year) was created. Overlaying zip code data on the map provided a more nuanced understanding of station dynamics.

A write-up accompanied the chosen map, detailing trends observed during the analysis, providing additional context for city officials.
Final Presentation

The project culminated in a cohesive Tableau story, strategically bringing together visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards. This final presentation ensures a professional, logical, and visually appealing overview for city officials, offering valuable insights into the Citi Bike program. The Tableau story, along with the URL to the Tableau Public workbook and any additional files used in the analysis, has been successfully submitted. This comprehensive analysis positions the New York Citi Bike program for informed decision-making and continued program enhancement.
